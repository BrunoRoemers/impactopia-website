**Impactopia** ambitions to be the first-ever real-life town hall where like-minded coops, DAOs, non-profits, citizens, activists, and artists join forces to create and build a new economic system for Humankind.

Over three days, **Impactopia** will offer a variety of insightful talks, panels, unconferences, workshops, and interactive events designed to:

* Foster synergies between projects and initiatives
* Create meaningful connections between participants
* Inspire with new stories and use cases
* Explore decentralised and collaborative structures (organisations, legal matters, governance and commons…)
* Share knowledge and co-construction processes (facilitation, liberating structures and other inclusive practices, …)
* Address the protection and regeneration of the Living (agriculture, environment, social justice, mindfulness, feminism, solarpunk, regens…)
* And most importantly, provide a fun and relaxing environment to enjoy it all in! Join us and become part of a community that is shaping a new economic system, built from the ground up by and for the people.
