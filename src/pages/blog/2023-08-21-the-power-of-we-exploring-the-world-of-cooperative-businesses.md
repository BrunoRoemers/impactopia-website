When people come together to achieve a common goal, something magical happens. A sense of community is born, values are shared, and powerful connections are made. This is precisely what cooperatives (coops) are all about. These are autonomous associations of individuals who voluntarily unite to meet their common economic, social, or cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly and democratically controlled enterprise. The definition may sound academic, but the spirit of cooperation is alive and well in every coop around the world.

There are seven principles that coops abide by. The first principle, voluntary and open membership, means that people cannot be forced to work. The second principle, democratic member control, ensures that the members control the organization democratically, with each member having one vote. The third principle, member economic participation, means that each member contributes equitably to the coop and buys a share of the common property. The fourth principle, autonomy and independence, ensure that coops are autonomous organizations and are controlled by their members. The fifth principle, education, training, and information, highlights the important role coops have in educating, training, and informing their members on various aspects, including cooperative values themselves. The sixth principle, cooperation among coops, emphasizes that they have a responsibility to help each other and strengthen the movement. Finally, the seventh principle, concern for the community, underscores that they prioritize taking care of their community, including the environment.

While these principles are the foundation of coops, there is plenty of room for innovation and creativity within them. For example, democratic processes can range from a general assembly to more participatory structures. Coops also come in all shapes and sizes, operating in any sector from IT to arts, banking, agriculture, and even pharmaceutical companies. The largest known coop, Mondragon, has nearly 80,000 workers, while others may only have a handful of members. The beauty of coops is that they are adaptable and flexible, and they can be tailored to suit the specific needs of a particular community or industry.

In today's world of growing inequality, social and environmental challenges, and economic uncertainty, coops offer a viable alternative to the traditional business model. They prioritize people over profits and are guided by values that make them socially responsible and caring for others. They are a way of life, a way of working, and a way of being. **Coops celebrate the power of we, reminding us that when people come together to achieve a common goal, something magical happens.** A sense of community is born, values are shared, and powerful connections are made.
