Impactopia's first podcast is an informative and engaging conversation about DAOs and co-ops or dummies, featuring two prominent guest speakers: Sarah De Heusch, who represents freelancers and entrepreneurs at a co-op, and Xavier Damman, a seasoned entrepreneur and DAO expert working with various organisations in the climate and blockchain space. The podcast discusses the challenges and opportunities of these two models for building equitable and sustainable communities and economies. It covers topics such as the basics of co-ops and DAOs, the role of crypto and blockchain, the potential for innovation and disruption, and the importance of social impact and governance. With the guidance of host Wil Meija, this podcast is a must-listen for anyone interested in DAOâ€™s and co-ops!
