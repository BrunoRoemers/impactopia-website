Impactopia's second podcast explores the Distributed Cooperative Organisations or DisCOs, a governance model that proposes an alternative to DAOs and Cooperatives. Irene Lopez de Vallejo, co-founder of disco.coop, presents their values, such as Open Cooperativism, Commons, P2P and Feminist Economics, the practices and challenges. She explains how DisCOs bring passion and care in the workplace and how the blockchain supports it.
